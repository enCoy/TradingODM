Course project - Online Decision Making
Comparison of different ODM models on trading

Data Preparation
We use AlphaVantage API to draw financial data. We chose 5 different stocks
because the API only allows 5 pull operations in a minute. These stocks are
determined as AAPL, GOOGL, GOLD, SBUX and MSFT. We ignored some
aspects of real trading environments for simplicity since main aim of the project
was to investigate online decision making approaches. For this reason terms
such as bidding and asking are ignored, and we only used the Adjusted Close
price of daily data to give trading orders. We used 1000 trading days. Orders are
executed each day. We also ignored ”shorting” option for computational simplicity.
The agents are only allowed to buy stocks. Initial balance is determined
as $10000.

Agent 1: FTL - maximize the average profit
Agent 2: FTL - maximize the number of rounds resulted in profit
Agent 3: FTPL with low noise
Agent 4: FTPL with medium level noise
Agent 5: FTPL with high noise
Agent 6: MWA algorithm
Agent 7: OGD algorithm
Agent 8: UCB algorithm (treating each stock as an arm)
Agent 9: UCB algorithm with a different confidence interval
Agent 10: UCB algorithm (treating each agent as an arm) - Agents to choose from are the first 9 agents
Agent 11: MWA algorithm on agents - Agents to choose from are the first 9 agents
Agent 12: MWA++ - Agent 11 chooses the best agent and invests all his/her money according to best
agent’s strategy. Instead, Agent 12 distributes its money over different agents
where the proportions are determined by MWA over the agents.
